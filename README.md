# portrait_generator

Portrait Generator is a small project which I did for my class "C++ Programming II" working with opencv and QT Designer. 
When you start the program it opens your webcam and tries to detect your face. The face detection is visualized with a bounding box. You can take a photo, move the bounding box and then save your face as picture to your local computer.
