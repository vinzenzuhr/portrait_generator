# Portrait Generator
Portrait Generator is a small project developed for the "C++ Programming II" class, utilizing OpenCV and QT Designer.

## Overview
This program uses OpenCV to interact with a webcam and performs facial detection using a bounding box to visualize the detected face. Users can capture a photo, adjust the bounding box as needed, and subsequently save the captured face as an image file on their local computer.
I've implemented the model-view-controller pattern with interfaces in C++, which is a bit over-engineered for this application, but was used as an exercise.

## Dependencies 
1. OpenCV
2. QT6
